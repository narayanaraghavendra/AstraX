# AstraX

AstraX
AstraX is a powerful, flexible, and efficient framework designed to integrate multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on easy deployment, monitoring, and task execution. Built to support a variety of LLMs like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, LLaMA, and more, AstraX is tailored for developers who need to orchestrate intelligent agents for complex tasks without the hassle of dealing with intricate dependencies.

AstraX comes equipped with features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), memory management, multiple LLM integrations, and custom agent execution, enabling seamless task execution and data processing across cloud and local environments.

Features
Multi-LLM Support: Easily integrates with popular LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, LLaMA, Grok, and others), allowing you to switch between models based on the task requirements.

Custom Agents: Create and manage intelligent agents using AstraX’s AstraxAgent class. These agents can perform specific tasks, use various tools, and integrate with different models.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Includes a custom retriever to enhance the LLM's responses by pulling in external knowledge from vector databases, effectively improving output relevance and accuracy.

Memory Management: Supports different types of memory for agents, including persistent memory and conversation buffers, enabling agents to remember previous interactions and perform tasks with context.

Cloud & Local Deployment: AstraX facilitates cloud deployment (AWS, GCP) or local deployments for your AI-powered applications.

API Integration: Supports seamless integration with third-party APIs and tools for extended functionality.

Modular Design: AstraX’s structure is highly modular, allowing developers to easily extend or swap components such as agents, LLMs, retrievers, and memories.

Error Handling & Logging: Built-in error handling using try-except blocks and comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
